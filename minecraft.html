    <p>Server whitelist is enabled. Contact a moderator if you want access to be granted to yourself or your friends.</p>
    <p>Server rules:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>All (large) automated farms must have an on/off switch and should be turned off when you leave the server. </li>
        <li>Similarly, try to minimize entity counts in farms and bases. Do not leave your boats behind while exploring.</li>
        <li>Server economy and currency is heavily discouraged. Instead, consider trading resources or favours!</li>
        <li>While pranking is allowed, do not irreversibly change or damage someone else's builds without their explicit permission. Do not steal or copy items from other players without permission and make sure to replace any items you borrow.</li>
        <li>Do not mod, hack, cheat or exploit bugs to gain an advantage that would not normally be available in regular gameplay. (Visual mods such as MiniHUD or Litematica are allowed!)</li>
        <li>Racism, sexism or discrimination on any other basis will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li>Everyone must comply by the <a href='https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines' target="_blank">usage guidelines</a> as set by Mojang Studios and Microsoft.</li>
        <li>Server mods hold the right to deny or revoke access to the server for any player at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To streamline multiplayer gameplay and increase server performance, several changes have been made to the vanilla Minecraft mechanics. Gameplay changes are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>The following gamerules have changed:
        	<ul>
            	<li><em>playersSleepingPercentage</em> has been set to 51%.</li>
                <li><em>ExplosionDropDecay</em> has been set to FALSE for all sources.</li>
                <li><em>simulation-distance</em> has been reduced to 8.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mobs can be silenced using name tags. 'Silence me', 'silence me' and 'silence_me' are all acceptable names.</li>
        <li>Players can type '/trigger spawn' to teleport to spawn.</li>
        <li>Players can type '/trigger ch_toggle' to show a small HUD showing current coordinates, direction and in-game time of day.</li>
        <li>To assist in the synchronization of nether portals, players can type '/trigger nc_inOverworld' to convert their current coordinates to nether coordinates, or '/trigger nc_inNether' to convert them to overworld coordinates.</li>
        <li>Shulker shells have been made more accessible by increasing their drop rate to two per shulker.</li>
        <li>Elytra and dragon eggs are now renewable through slaying of the ender dragon.</li>
        <li><a href='https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/' target="_blank">Crafting recipes</a> have been added for name tags, horse armour, leather (smelting), blackstone, gravel, and enchanted golden apples. Additionally, all unpackables have been added, as well as all dye related recipes and 'back to blocks'.</li>
        <li>Finally, concrete can be crafted in bulk by dropping stacks of concrete powder into a cauldron filled with water.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently, voice chat and proximity voice chat are <b>not</b> implemented on the server, as this would require players to install mods to use certain server functionality. Though this topic is still open for discussion, for now you can make use of the <a href='https://discord.com/invite/n5TU8rxaRF' target="_blank">discord</a> voice-call functionality or connect through other third-party means.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of finding biome types or slime chunks, the server seed is <a href='https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map#-4935325944529060349' target="_blank">-4935325944529060349</a>. Please keep things fun for yourself and limit the search for structures in this way.</p>
